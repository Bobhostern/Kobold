# A trait is just a partially implemented struct
# A trait can have call, and everything a struct has, but it cannot be instantiated
# (construct syntax fails)
# In addition, you can use vcall (virtual call), and vmessage (virtual message)
# to create calls, and messages that simply call (inner).

# () means generics. Place virtual type names here.
#trait ConvertTo(X) {

#};

#vcall(X) ConvertTo(X) [convert: ConvertTo(X)] -> X;
